# Students-Sorting-System

Sorting Students by GPA and Name
Project Overview
This C++ project demonstrates the use of seven different sorting algorithms to sort a list of students based on their GPA and names. The algorithms implemented include:

Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Bubble Sort
Shell Sort
Counting Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Each algorithm sorts the list of students by GPA and also analyzes the time and the number of comparisons taken to perform the sort.

Features
Sorting by GPA and Name: The project sorts students' records, which consist of a name, ID, and GPA, based on their GPA in descending order.
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Seven different algorithms have been implemented, each of which showcases different efficiencies and performances.
Performance Analysis: The project measures the number of comparisons and the time taken by each algorithm in microseconds, providing insight into their relative performance.
